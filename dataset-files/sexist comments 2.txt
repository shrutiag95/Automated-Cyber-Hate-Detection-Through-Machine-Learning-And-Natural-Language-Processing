#mkr deconstructed by girls that have deconstructed brains  ! Nearly brought up my dinner when I saw that crap on the plate
In the words of former contestant @whatsnextjake , Katie and Nikki need to calm their farm. #MKR
I cannot stop looking at Nikki's dreadful black crooked bra #MKR #MKR2015

Isn't the drama thrilling from this two on #MKR couldn't make it up.  The chicks are gold and won't lose tonight, even if can't cook
I will not be using killer blondes as a hash tag! #MKR
Shut up Katie and Nikki... That is all :)

When Will people learn? They are not that hot. Pride always comes before a fall.
Watch tarts with poorly constructed personalities deconstruct a tart. #mkr

Sassy...? More like femme bots than killer blondes... #mkr
How the f#*k are they "models"? #MKR
@mykitchenrules #MKR The girls are bringing some "Sassy-ges" to the table.
Just me, or hot blondes on #mkr not at all hot?? Just average!
"@NewIdeamagazine:They weren't kidding when they said deconstructed! #mkr" Yeh. Seen better shit in women's magazi... Oh. Right...Sorry #MKR
Katie and Nikki have definitely proved they're not just dumb blondes with pretty faces. They're just dumb blondes. #mkr

@_saral93 not to mention these same girls on #MKR have super inflated egos considering they didn't cook that well and aren't very nice
Yes, we get it. You're pretty. Tone down the self promo and just cook! @mykitchenrules #MKR
If I hear "hot" "pretty" "sassy" "like us" one more time.. I will deconstruct.. #MKR #killerblondes

Maybe the girls should have less tickets on themselves and worry about the cooking. #MKR
“@walslab: Out of the two blondes, which one is Beavis and which is Butthead #MKR” Does it matter?
those blond girls make me crazy, they are so annoying #mkr
Catching up with #MKR. If society judges these two as pretty then I really have no friggin hope.
If you talk the talk, you gotta walk the walk!! Do the girls know the recipe for humble pie??? #MKR
@mykitchenrules I think the pink has gone to the girls head #imbeautiful #MKR
Think these two girls have wayyy to many tickets kn themselves #MKR  #PromoGirls #promogirls i think not

#MKR2015 #MKR why do they keep saying that they are so pretty
Is #mkr sexist then? Four of the six teams in the fourth instant restaurants are an all-female team.
Nikki &amp; Katie is what happens when parents continually tell their kids, "You're a winner in my eyes." &amp; avoid constructive feedback #mkr
#MKR anyone can cook from a can girls.
SHUTUP ABOUT THE SASS &amp; READ SOME COOKERY BOOKS YOU TWIT. #MKR
why is their whole menu dick related?!?!?! #MKR
STOP SAYING SASS OR I WILL PUT MY FOOT UP YOUR ASS #MKR
This is supposed to be a fucking cooking show not a bunch of faggots walking stupidly down a runway #cringeworthy #mkr
#MKR you'd think in her downtime Annie would have paid Napoléon Perdis a visit and learnt not to use the same coloured blush as your hair...
Kim Kardashian's husband will grow his dick back by the time this series finishes. #MKR
What a riveting little lesson in walking the catwalk. Thanks ladies #MKR
The format to #mkr is stupid. It'll be about 10 weeks until we see the Cowboy and his fit daughter cook again.
The missus loves #MKR if I have to watch five more minutes of these stuck up, idiotic, 2 bit hookers I'll neck myself. #goingtobed
yeah colin would be looking for more fat in his sausage.... #MKR

It's obvious the blonde bimbos make better TV according to Channel 7. Shit cooks #mkr

Neither girls can cook to save themselves, Nikki just wants her face on camera, 15 minutes of fame #mkr
Go fuck yourself Kat, stupid slut #MKR #nofucksgiven
BULLSHIT! Kat &amp; Andre you are deadset CUNTS! #MKR
Yes Kat and Andre were unsportsmanlike but even if they scored 3 or 4 like everyone else the bimbos still wouldn't have got through #mkr
Catching up on #mkr, disgraceful behaviour from Kat and Andre. Strategic scoring won't save them forever.
STFU KAT YA BITCH! #MKR

Wtf Kat and Andre are cheaters! THAT IS SO UNFAIR. THEY CANNOT GIVE SOMEONE 1. THEY SHOULD BE GONE. #mkr #katandandre #byebye #bitches
Yup there still hot blondes #mkr
Bye bye bitches. Your ego might go down a notch now.  #mkr
The major coincidence in the score that Kat &amp; Andre gave is ...that Kat recently scored 1 on her home IQ test. #mkr
Karma will fuck you in the ass and cum all over back Kat #MKR
MiddleInformer: RT benpobjie: Credit to Kat: she puts a hell of a lot more effort into badmouthing others than she does her cooking #MKR
@mykitchenrules How about next season you hold off on the scores until all the teams have cooked, so strategy plays no part. Food does. #MKR
Stick it up em Kat, you're the sort of bitch that really makes the show #MKR
Kat you are a fucking cunt rash, a deadset fucking thundercunt rash #MKR

@pixieyas @greenlinerzjm @versacezaynx @nyazpolitics What does your Quran 33:33 say, bitch.
@halalflaws @AMohedin @islamdefense @haroonstyles @greenlinerzjm It says women must stay at home and not display themselves.
@AMohedin Again skipping what you don't like. It says that men are in charge of women and men are superior to women. http://t.co/5mAnQbibj1
@AMohedin And at the end it clearly states that beating women is an option if that's what it takes to make her obey.
@AMohedin It doesn't say "mentally beat them". It says, "beat them". You are sugar coating for the kiddies and women.
@AMohedin Being strong physically does not mean strong mentally. The verse clearly says that a husband can force his will on a wife.
@halalflaws @haroonstyles @AMohedin @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm So 33:33 tells women to stay home and cover up.
@halalflaws @haroonstyles @AMohedin @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm And 4:34 tells women that men are superior and that husbands can beat wives
@AMohedin What is it that women lack that requires two women witnesses to replace one man?
@AMohedin Okay, we have women being physically inferior and the either emotionally or mentally inferior in some way.
